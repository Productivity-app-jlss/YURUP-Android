## Overview
### Description
YURUP, is a mobile productivity application that keeps track of the users' goals. This app allows the user to invite friends and family members to join a goal/challenge they have created. Through the app, users can send reminders to friends/family members to keep up with the challenge they committed to. It is like checking in with your close ones to see how they are doing and are they keeping up with their goals. In a rough time, like now, the productivity level is low. This application will help increase productivity and bring a sense of support from friends and family.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity / Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could more emphasized due to the mobility.
- **Story:** Sharing goals/challenges, inviting people to participate in a challenge that was created, Reminding each other to complete the challenge.
- **Market:** It can be used by anyone that would like to achieve a goal/ challenge. The user can choose to invite others to join the challenge so that they can support and motivate each other to accomplish their mutual goals. User doesn't have to share their goals. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how many challenges (ongoing) they have created for themselves or with their friends/ family members. 
- **Scope:** In the beginning stage of creating this app, it will allow the user to create short term goals and check them off their list. In the next stage, it will allow the user to create a daily/weekly/monthly challenge which means the user would need to check off that they accomplished the challenge of the day/week/month. Afterward, we will implement more stretch stories for the application, such as badges for the milestone, a timer .. etc
