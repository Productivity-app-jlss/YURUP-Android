## Overview
### Description
A productivity app that shares activities with friends and family members, and insprires the participants by monitoring and reminding them the joined activities. Could be a standalone app or integrated with a social media app.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity / Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could more emphasized due to the mobility.
- **Story:** Share activities, and invite people with same interest. The users can remind each other based on the goal and setting.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and people would be organized into interest groups potentially to be interested in similar activities in the future.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how committed they are to the participating activities, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with inviting people based on invite code, then perhaps it could evolve towards a social networking app by having a friend list and shared activities.
